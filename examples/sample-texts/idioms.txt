The ball is in your court.

Spill the beans.

Kick the bucket.

Burn the midnight oil.

When pigs fly.

A blessing in disguise.

Let the cat out of the bag.

Bite off more than you can chew.

Break the ice.

Hit the nail on the head.

Throw in the towel.

Actions speak louder than words.

Cut corners.

Caught between a rock and a hard place.

The devil is in the details.

Keep your fingers crossed.

Don’t cry over spilled milk.

Raining cats and dogs.

Add fuel to the fire.

You can’t have your cake and eat it too.

I have a frog in my throat.
